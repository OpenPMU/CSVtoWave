# CSVtoWave
Covert OpenPMU Sampled Values (SV) CPOW recordings into Wave audio files

Please note, this code is only for use on old format CSV CPOW records.  It has been made obsolete by the new SVtoWave workflow.  

All new SV/CPOW data will be produced using [SVtoWave](https://github.com/OpenPMU/SVtoWave).
